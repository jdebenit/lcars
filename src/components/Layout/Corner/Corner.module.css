/* 
   Simplest approach for a scalable LCARS elbow:
   A container div that has the width/height of the whole shape.
   It has a background color.
   Masking or nested divs to "cut out" the inside?
   
   Better: Two bars connecting? No, that shows a seam.
   
   Classic CSS trick:
   A single block with a border-radius on ONE corner.
   But we need the "inside" to be transparent.
   
   So it's an L-shape.
   
   Approach: 
   Main container: relative, width/height as specified.
   
   A pseudo-element or child div acting as the vertical leg.
   A pseudo-element or child div acting as the horizontal leg.
   Wait, if we do that, the intersection has to be perfect.
   
   Alternative:
   A single div with width = overall width, height = overall height.
   Border-radius on the outside corner.
   Then a generic "inner content" that masks it? No.
   
   Let's go with the "Cutout" approach which is robust for fixed colors.
   Outer div: Width/Height defined. Background Color = LCARS color. Border-radius on relevant corner.
   Inner div: Absolute positioned. Background Color = Parent Background (Black/Transparent). 
              Border-radius on relevant inner corner.
              
   Wait, the "Inner" part of the LCARS curve is also rounded!
   LCARS elbows have constant thickness.
   
   So:
   Outer Box (The Shape)
     - Width: [width]
     - Height: [height]
     - Background: [LCARS Color]
     - Border-Top-Left-Radius: [height / 2] (for example, if it's a top-left elbow)
     
   Inner Cutout (The Void)
     - Positioned inside.
     - Background: transparent (this component doesn't know what's behind it... wait, usually it's black background).
     - If we can't assume black background, we must use SVG or Clip-path.
     - SVG is safest for "transparent" background.
